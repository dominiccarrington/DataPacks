# My DataPacks!
This is where I keep track of all the changes of the datapacks I have created.

## `.add.mcfunction` files
These files have custom markup inside to help with creating the more complex parts of datapack creation. See `build.js` to see the conversion code. These files will be put aside by Minecraft since they are invalid function files.

**If there is a .add.mcfunction file, please edit that version instead of the .mcfunction**

Custom Markup includes:
- Writing custom markdown to create books/tellraw commands
- *More to follow*
